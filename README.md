# Electric Vehicles Range Analysis

## Project descrption 
This project explores the electric vehicle (EV) range based on different EV types and how it has evolved over the years. By analyzing historical data, I identify trends in EV range improvements, compare the performance of various EV types (such as battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids) and visualize the findings.
